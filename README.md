Introduction
============

Implementation of a RAML parser for Python based on PyYAML. It is compliant with RAML 0.8 http://raml.org/spec.html


Installation
============

The pyraml package can be installed with ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` from GIT repository or from tarball.

    $ pip install https://github.com/an2deg/pyraml-parser/archive/master.zip

For Python 2.6 packages ``ordereddict`` and 'lxml' should be installed:

    $ pip install ordereddict lxml


Developing pyraml-paser
-----------------------

You may need to install ``nose``, ``tox`` and ``mock`` packages to run pyraml-parser tests.

Typical installation process for developing purposes:

    $ git clone git@github.com:an2deg/pyraml-parser.git
    $ cd pyraml-parser
    $ pip install mock
    $ python setup.py develop

To run tests on all supported python versions:

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

Or to run tests with ``nose``:

    $ pip install nose
    $ python -m nose

Or to run tests using ``unittest``:

    $ python setup.py test

Using pyraml-parser
===================

An instance of the ``RamlRoot`` object can be obtained by calling the ``pyraml.parser.load``
function:

    import pyraml.parser

    p = pyraml.parser.load('schema.raml')

    print p
